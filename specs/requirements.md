# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Customer Information Management System that provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing customer records. The system will include a web interface for user interaction and utilize AWS services for data persistence and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Customer Record Creation

3. WHEN a user submits an invalid customer form THE SYSTEM SHALL display validation errors for required fields
4. WHEN a user provides a duplicate email address THE SYSTEM SHALL display an error message indicating email must be unique

### Requirement 2: Customer Record Retrieval
**User Story:** As a business user, I want to view customer records, so that I can access customer information when needed.

4. WHEN a user cancels an edit operation THE SYSTEM SHALL return to the customer list without saving changes

### Requirement 4: Customer Record Deletion

3. WHEN a user cancels deletion THE SYSTEM SHALL return to the customer list without deleting the record
4. WHEN a customer record is deleted THE SYSTEM SHALL ensure the record is permanently removed from the database

### Requirement 5: Data Persistence and Reliability
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want customer data to be reliably stored and accessible, so that business operations can continue without data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN customer data is submitted THE SYSTEM SHALL persist the data using AWS DynamoDB
2. WHEN the system experiences high load THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain performance and data consistency
3. WHEN data is retrieved THE SYSTEM SHALL return accurate and up-to-date information
4. WHEN the system is accessed THE SYSTEM SHALL provide sub-second response times for CRUD operations

### Requirement 6: Web Interface Usability
**User Story:** As a business user, I want an intuitive web interface, so that I can efficiently manage customer information without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accesses the application THE SYSTEM SHALL display a clean, responsive web interface
